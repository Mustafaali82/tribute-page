    <ul>
        <li>Research has shown that emoji are often misunderstood. In some cases, this misunderstanding is related to how the actual emoji design is interpreted by the viewer;[78] in other cases, the emoji that was sent is not shown in the same way on the receiving side.</li>
        <li>The first issue relates to the cultural or contextual interpretation of the emoji. When the author picks an emoji, they think about it in a certain way, but the same character may not trigger the same thoughts in the mind of the receiver.</li>
        <li>The second problem relates to technology and branding. When an author of a message picks an emoji from a list, it is normally encoded in a non-graphical manner during the transmission, and if the author and the reader do not use the same software or operating system for their devices, the reader's device may visualize the same emoji in a different way.</li>
        <li>The introduction of the new emojis had numerous teething issues, with feedback from many on the cultural differences between different countries and also the misuse.</li>
        <li>Famously, both the peach and the eggplant were used for other meanings and others were often used for criminal purposes. This led to the gun emoji getting removed and replaced with a water gun.</li>
